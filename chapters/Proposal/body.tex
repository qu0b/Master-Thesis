% Motivation
% * why
Negotiating Service Level Agreements (SLA) is a key part in acquiring cloud resources. Although many cloud providers do not 


Internet of Things (IoT) devices have very limited hardware and can benefit greatly from obtaining compute capacity. The distributed nature and sheer quantity of IoT devices makes it impractical for humans to negotiate SLA's on behalf of devices, especially when requirements are constantly changing. As stated \cite{autonomous-agent} there is a need a for an autonomous negotiation framework. 

It shows, that it is not only hard to find an algorithm to negotiate on one's behalf, but it is also hard to find a provider whom you can trust.
% * trust
Using the Ethereum Blockchain, we make it possible to enforce autonomously negotiated SLA. This is done by storing the multi-round negotiation process.
