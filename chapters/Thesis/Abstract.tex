Decentralized utility computing will become a reality. Currently, autonomous negotiation requires trust between provider and consumer. In this paper we look at how to make deals without the need for trust. Anyone will be able to sell their computing capacity on a utility computing marketplace.


%In this paper we show that it is possible and practical use a blockchain as a source of truth when negotiating web service agreements. Specifically we look look at bidirectional negotiation between a provider and consumer.
