\noindent This package contains a minimal, modern template for writing your
thesis. While originally meant to be used for a Ph.\,D.\ thesis, you can
equally well use it for your honour thesis, bachelor thesis, and so
on---some adjustments may be necessary, though.

\section{Why?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I was not satisfied with the available templates for \LaTeX{} and wanted
to heed the style advice given by people such as Robert
Bringhurst~\cite{Bringhurst12} or Edward R.\
Tufte~\cite{Tufte90,Tufte01}. While there \emph{are} some packages out
there that attempt to emulate these styles, I found them to be either
too bloated, too playful, or too constraining. This template attempts to
produce a beautiful look without having to resort to any sort of hacks.
I hope you like it.
