	Abstract = {Cloud  computing  and  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  are
computing  technologies  that  provide  services  to  consumers  and
businesses,  allowing  organizations  to  become  more  agile  and
flexible.  Therefore,  ensuring  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  through
Service  Level  Agreements  (SLAs)  for  such  cloud-based  services
is  crucial  for  both  the  service  providers  and  service  consumers.
As  SLAs  are  critical  for  cloud  deployments  and  wider  adoption
of  cloud  services,  the  management  of  SLAs  in  cloud  and  IoT
has  thus  become  an  important  and  essential  aspect.  This  paper
investigates  the  existing  research  on  the  management  of  SLAs
in  IoT  applications  that  are  based  on  cloud  services.  For  this
purpose,  a  Systematic  Mapping  study  (a  well-defined  method)
is  conducted  to  identify  the  published  research  results  that  are
relevant   to   SLAs.   The   paper   identifies   328   primary   studies
and  categorizes  them  into  seven  main  technical  classifications:
SLA  management,  SLA  definition,  SLA  modeling,  SLA  negoti-
ation,  SLA  monitoring,  SLA  violation  and  trustworthiness,  and
SLA  evolution.  The  paper  also  summarizes  the  research  types,
research  contributions,  and  demographic  information  in  these
studies.  The  evaluation  of  the  results  show  that  most  of  the
approaches   for   managing   SLAs   are   applied   in   academic   or
controlled  experiments  with  limited  industrial  settings  rather
than  in  real  industrial  environments.  Many  studies  focus  on
proposal  models  and  methods  to  manage  SLAs,  and  there  is  a
lack of focus on the evolution perspective and a lack of adequate
tool support to facilitate practitioners in their SLA management
activities.  Moreover,  the  scarce  number  of  studies  focusing  on
concrete  metrics  for  qualitative  or  quantitative  assessment  of
QoS  in  SLAs  urges  the  need  for  in-depth  research  on  metrics
definition  and  measurements  for  SLAs},

	Abstract = {Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for organizations to adopt IT services at a reduced cost with increased reliability and scalability. However organizations are slow in adopting the cloud model due to the prevalent vendor lock-in issue and challenges associated with it. While the existing cloud solutions for public and private companies are vendor locked-in by design, their existence is subject to limited possibility to interoperate with other cloud systems. In this paper we have presented a critical review of pertinent business, technical and legal issues associated with vendor lock-in, and how it impacts on the widespread adoption of cloud computing. The paper attempts to reflect on the issues associated with interoperability and portability, but with a focus on vendor lock-in. Moreover, the paper demonstrates the importance of interoperability, portability and standards applicable to cloud computing environments along with highlighting other corporate concerns due to the lock-in problem. The outcome of this paper provides a foundation for future analysis and review regarding the impact of vendor neutrality for corporate cloud computing application and services.},

	Abstract = {Service oriented Utility Computing paves the way towards realization of service markets, which promise metered services through negotiable Service Level Agreements (SLA). A market does not necessarily imply a simple buyer-seller relationship, rather it is the culmination point of a complex chain of stake-holders with a hierarchical integration of value along each link in the chain. In service value chains, services corresponding to different partners are aggregated in a producer-consumer manner resulting in hierarchical structures of added value. SLAs are contracts between service providers and service consumers, which ensure the expected Quality of Service (QoS) to different stakeholders at various levels in this hierarchy. This thesis addresses the challenge of realizing SLA-centric infrastructure to enable service markets for Utility Computing.
Service Level Agreements play a pivotal role throughout the life cycle of service aggregation. The activities of service selection and service negotiation followed by the hierarchical aggregation and validation of services in service value chain, require SLA as an enabling technology. This research aims at a SLA-centric framework where the requirement-driven selection of services, flexible SLA negotiation, hierarchical SLA aggregation and validation, and related issues such as privacy, trust and security have been formalized and the prototypes of the service selection model and the validation model have been implemented. The formal model for User-driven service selection utilizes Branch and Bound and Heuristic algorithms for its implementation. The formal model is then extended for SLA negotiation of configurable services of varying granularity in order to tweak the interests of the service consumers and service providers.
The possibility of service aggregation opens new business opportunities in the evolving landscape of IT-based Service Economy. A SLA as a unit of business relationships helps establish innovative topologies for business networks. One example is the composition of computational services to construct services of bigger granularity thus giving room to business models based on service aggregation, Composite Service Provision and Reselling. This research introduces and formalizes the notions of SLA Choreography and hierarchical SLA aggregation in connection with the underlying service choreography to realize SLA-centric service value chains and business networks. The SLA Choreography and aggregation poses new challenges regarding its description, management, maintenance, validation, trust, privacy and security. The aggregation and validation models for SLA Choreography introduce concepts such as: SLA Views to protect the privacy of stakeholders; a hybrid trust model to foster business among unknown partners; and a PKI security mechanism coupled with rule based validation system to enable distributed queries across heterogeneous boundaries. A distributed rule based hierarchical SLA validation system is designed to demonstrate the practical significance of these notions.},

	Abstract = {With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta- negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing `Storage Clouds' for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision.},

	Abstract = {Cloud service level agreement negotiation is a process of joint decision-making between cloud clients and providers to resolve their conflicting objectives. With the advances of cloud technology, opera- tions such as discovery, scaling, monitoring and decommissioning are accomplished automatically. Therefore, negotiation between cloud clients and providers can be a bottleneck if it is carried out man- ually. Our objective is to propose a state-of-the-art solution to automate the negotiation process for cloud environments and specifically infrastructure as a service category. The proposed negotiation strategy is based on a time-dependent tactic. For cloud providers, the strategy uniquely considers uti- lization of resources when generating new offers and automatically adjusts the tactic's parameters to concede more on the price of less utilized resources. In addition, while the previous negotiation strate- gies in literature trust offered quality of service values regardless of their dependability, our proposed strategy is capable of assessing reliability of offers received from cloud providers. Furthermore, to find the right configuration of the time-dependent tactic in cloud computing environments, we inves- tigate the effect of modifying parameters such as initial offer value and deadline on negotiation out- puts that include ratio of deals made, and inequality index. The proposed negotiation strategy is tested with different workloads and in diverse market conditions to show how the time-dependent tactic's settings can dynamically adapt to help cloud providers increase their profits.},
	Annote = {* SLA is to resolve conflicting objectives
* Focus on IaaS
* Time-dependent approach
* The less a resource of a provider is used the more he is willing to give a discount
* Steps
  1. Discovery
  2. Scaling
  3. Monitoring
  4. Decomissioning 

The paper argues that the missing piece i.e. the bottle neck of autonomous provisioning of cloud resources is the negotiation. All of the other steps are already autonomous.

SLAN - Service level Agreement negotiation is the process in which conflicting objectives are resolved. 

It is difficult to map the policies/objectives to the decision making process
  1. find the goals
  2. implement the goals

Kategories of parameters to classify terms

requirements: functional | non-functional | Quality of Service (QoS) 
negotiable and non-negotiable.

Improve the overall system utility. Providers are interested in a SLA negotiation strategy that dynamically adapts to changes in data center resources utilization and market conditions instead of having a off the shelves approach.

Consider talking about serverless

	Abstract = {Trading of cloud services suffers from the lack of market liquidity. Market liquidity ensures sustainable market
activity of cloud services and it can be enhanced by introducing novel negotiation processes between the cloud vendors and cloud buyers. Such negotiation processes are ice breakers in case of rigid customer requirements and/or service offers. In this paper we propose a formal model of Service Level Agreement (SLA) based negotiations that allow agent-based multi round SLA negotiation for making dynamic offers influenced by varying client requirements, different pricing model and decision strategies. The model is implemented using WSAG4J library that is an implementation of WS-Agreement standard and results manifest that further complexity by introducing proprietary business rules can be added to facilitate real-time bilateral negotiation in cloud services.

},
	Annote = {This paper tries to improve market liquidity between provders and consumers by introducing a standardized negotiation process. The negotiation is done by an agent with dynamic requirements.

* The off the shelves approach is bad for
  * variying needs

Frameworks: WS Agreement [9], SNAP [], bilateral protocol [8], WSLA [10], QML [11], WSOL [12], SLAng [14].

Concludes that WS Agreement is the most popular and it was developed by the open grid forum.

* It is hard to find an algorithm that can carry out the negotiation on behalf of a consumer
* There is a need for a complete automated negotiation framework


Not only is it hard to find an algorithm to negotiate on ones behalf but it is also hard to find a provider wohm you can trust.

This work tweaked the requirements to find different feasible solutions with an additional happyness metric.
