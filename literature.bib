	Abstract = {Trading of cloud services suffers from the lack of market liquidity. Market liquidity ensures sustainable market
activity of cloud services and it can be enhanced by introducing novel negotiation processes between the cloud vendors and cloud buyers. Such negotiation processes are ice breakers in case of rigid customer requirements and/or service offers. In this paper we propose a formal model of Service Level Agreement (SLA) based negotiations that allow agent-based multi round SLA negotiation for making dynamic offers influenced by varying client requirements, different pricing model and decision strategies. The model is implemented using WSAG4J library that is an implementation of WS-Agreement standard and results manifest that further complexity by introducing proprietary business rules can be added to facilitate real-time bilateral negotiation in cloud services.
